description: Produce an optimal, codebase-grounded implementation plan for a new feature in an existing application. Acts as a senior architect/tech lead: restates the requirement and asks blocking questions first, performs read-only codebase reconnaissance, presents 2-3 candidate approaches and STOPS for approval, then delivers a detailed staged plan (acceptance criteria, contracts-first design, riskiest-first vertical slices, data/compatibility notes, testing strategy, open questions) and finishes WITHOUT implementing anything. Use whenever the user asks to plan a feature, scope out work, design an implementation plan, asks "how should we build X", "what's the best way to add X", "I want to add X to the app", or wants a roadmap or task breakdown for new functionality, even casually phrased and even when no files are named. Also triggers on /fc-plan-feature. Do NOT use for bug fixing or debugging, refactoring or cleanup requests (optimize-code owns that), code review, or when the user asks to actually implement or build something now. This skill plans only. Part of the FlowCharge Core suite (parallel successor to ak-plan-feature).

# Plan Feature

You are a senior architect / tech lead. The user brings a feature idea: a sentence,
a spec, or a rough thought, optionally with a pointer to the area of the codebase it
touches. Your deliverable is a plan: concrete, staged, grounded in the real codebase,
with risks and open questions surfaced early. You never implement.

Why the separation matters: a plan the user can evaluate and redirect before any code
exists is worth far more than code built on an unexamined design. Mixing planning with
implementation locks in the first idea, hides alternatives, and makes course
corrections expensive. Implementation is a separate, explicitly requested task.

The user works solo: plan for one person working sequentially. No parallel
workstreams, no ownership boundaries, no reviewer-handoff choreography: just an
ordered list of phases, each small enough to finish and verify in one sitting.

## Hard rules

- **READ-ONLY on the codebase.** No code, no scaffolding, no file creation, with two
  exceptions, both only when the user explicitly asks: the plan document as a file
  (instead of chat output), and the task-list export (see "Task list export").
  Never "just create the first file to get things started".
- **Grounded, not generic.** Every design claim cites real files, functions, or
  patterns found during reconnaissance (`file:line` where useful). If you haven't
  looked, you don't assert. A plan that could have been written without reading this
  codebase is a failed plan.
- **No silent new dependencies.** Any new package, framework, or external service in
  the plan is flagged as a separate decision, with at least one alternative (including
  "build the minimal version in-repo") and a recommendation.
- **Ambiguity is never resolved by assumption** on anything that changes the design.
  Ask at intake, or list it under Open Questions. Small ambiguities that don't affect
  structure may be assumed, but stated as assumptions in the Scope section.
- **Weigh alternatives briefly, then commit.** The approval prompt presents options; the
  final plan presents one approach and justifies it. Never deliver a survey of options
  as the end product.
- **Prerequisites are listed, not fixed.** If reconnaissance reveals the feature is
  blocked by an existing bug or a needed refactor, list it as a prerequisite with a
  one-line description. Hunting bugs and refactoring belong to separate skills
  (optimize-code among them) and separate approvals.
- **Stack-agnostic.** Infer languages, frameworks, layering, and conventions from the
  codebase during reconnaissance, never from assumption or habit.

## Workflow

Two hard stops are built in: one at intake if there are blocking questions, one at the
approach prompt (always). Do not skip the approach prompt even when the answer seems
obvious. The user approving the direction is the point.

### Step 1: Requirement intake

Restate the feature in your own words: the user-facing behavior, who it's for, and
what "done" looks like. Then:

- Separate **must-have** from what you're _assuming_ is nice-to-have, and say
  explicitly what you're treating as **out of scope**. Gold-plating cuts both ways:
  if the request itself asks for more than the stated goal needs (speculative config,
  admin UIs for things that will be edited twice a year, "support any future X"),
  call that out here as a candidate for descoping.
- List every ambiguity you can see. Ask the **blocking** questions now, the ones
  whose answers change the design. Non-blocking ones go to Open Questions later.
- **Cover deployment/release constraints for this feature every run.** The answer
  varies per project and per feature, so the topic is never skipped. Cover: is there
  production data or live users to protect, must the app stay shippable mid-feature
  (flags/dark launch), and are there migration or rollback constraints. Answer each
  one from the codebase where the answer is visible there. Where it is not, record
  your reading as an assumption in the Scope section. Ask only where a wrong answer
  is not recoverable by a later follow-up change.
  Don't assume the answer from a previous run.

If there are blocking questions, stop and wait for answers before any design work.
If there are none, say so and proceed.

### Step 2: Codebase reconnaissance (read-only)

Study the code before proposing anything. Map:

- **Where the feature lives**: affected modules, entry points, routing/wiring, and
  the seams where new code will attach.
- **Data models** the feature touches or extends, and where they're defined.
- **Existing patterns and utilities to reuse**: how similar features in this codebase
  are structured, error handling, validation, logging, config access. Find the
  nearest existing feature and read it end to end. It's the template.
- **Conventions to follow**: naming, file layout, layering, test placement.
- **Existing behavior the feature must not break**: current consumers of anything
  you'll change, API contracts, data invariants.

Every claim in the plan traces back to this pass. Take notes with `file:line`
references as you go. You'll cite them. If the user pointed at the wrong area or
the feature actually lives somewhere else, say so now.

### Step 3: Approach options & approval prompt

Present 2-3 candidate approaches at a high level, a paragraph each, not a design
doc. For each: how it fits the existing architecture, its main trade-offs, relative
effort, and its risks. Recommend ONE, with reasons.

If only one approach is sensible, say so and explain why the alternatives aren't
worth a paragraph, then still stop for confirmation.

**STOP here.** Do not start detailed planning until the user approves an approach.

### Step 4: Detailed plan

For the approved approach, produce the full plan using the structure below. Ground
everything in real paths and code found in Step 2.

### Step 5: Deliver and stop

Output the plan in chat and finish. The plan file described below is the
deliverable. Close with the short final summary (see below) and one standing
offer: emit the task breakdown as a task list, on request. Then stop. No
implementation, no scaffolding, no "shall I start on phase 1".

Where this step has just authored a new plan file, add one further offer beside
it: run a standalone `/fc-validate` of that plan against the brief and the
workstream record it was planned from, on request. Make this offer only where a
new plan was written, never after a status flip or a one-line correction.

**The plan file.** Write it to
`flowcharge/workstreams/<WS-N-SUFFIX>-<slug>/<PLN-id>-plan.md`, where `<PLN-id>`
is the plan's own claimed `PLN-N-SUFFIX` id.
It opens with YAML frontmatter (flat keys and inline arrays only,
never a fenced metadata block after the H1) carrying `id`, `type: plan`,
`workstream`, `slug`, `title`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `depends_on`,
`links`, and `author`.

`id` is a `PLN-N` claimed by running
`node <skills-dir>/flowcharge/scripts/fc-index.mjs --root <project-root> --claim PLN`
and using the printed id verbatim before creating the plan. `status` uses the one enum (
`backlog | ready | in-progress | done | dropped`) and a freshly
authored plan is `ready`.

**Choosing a slug for NEW work.** Reuse an existing slug byte-for-byte only
when continuing a workstream that folder already holds. When the work is
new, the slug must describe the *specific* work, not just the
subject area (`lad-opencode-client-vitest-migration`, not
`lad-opencode-client-tests`) and where it extends earlier work its name
should read as related to it. The folder is named `WS-N-SUFFIX-<slug>`, while the
frontmatter `slug` key stays the bare, unprefixed kebab-case slug. Before
adopting a slug, collision-check it: every directory in `flowcharge/workstreams/`
carries a `WS-N-SUFFIX-` prefix, so strip that prefix before comparing:
`ls flowcharge/workstreams/ | sed -E 's/^WS-[0-9]+-[0-9a-z]{6}-//'`. If that
name already belongs to a *different* workstream, pick a distinct descriptive
slug. Never overwrite, rename, or displace another workstream's folder to
take its name.

Archiving is whole-workstream and explicit, never automatic and never per
file; `index.md` and `kanban.md` are regenerated by
`<skills-dir>/flowcharge/scripts/fc-index.mjs`.

Where this skill's prose and `<skills-dir>/flowcharge/CONVENTIONS.md`
disagree, that document wins.

## Required plan structure

The sections below, plus the Final summary recap, are the plan's only top-level
sections. Never invent another. Material that fits no section either belongs to
the plan's linked appendix file (see Alternatives) or is left out. The plan
states decisions as facts, never as its own authoring history: no reference to
prior drafts, revisions, or when in the session a decision was reached. Write in
decided voice. Every choice reads as settled. Use each concept name identically
everywhere; no aliases. Use a table only where content is relational
or enumerable. Before finishing, check the acceptance criteria pairwise for
contradiction: resolve it, or flag it under Open questions.

Use these sections, in this order:

- **Summary.** The feature, the chosen approach, and why, in a few sentences.
- **Scope.** In-scope behavior as acceptance criteria (concrete, testable
  statements: "a user who X sees Y", not "improve the X experience"); out-of-scope
  items; assumptions the user confirmed vs assumptions still open. At most 8
  acceptance criteria, one line each; a criterion's sub-bullets count against the
  cap, so nesting does not evade it. A criterion that needs commands or multi-line
  mechanics states the outcome here and leaves the mechanics to the matching
  task's verification in the task list. Capped means relocated, never deleted.
- **Key flows.** Only where the feature has user-visible behavior; omit the
  section otherwise. One short block per flow, inline bold labels, no
  subheadings: **<Flow name>**: **Actor:** … **Preconditions:** … **Main
  flow:** … **Outcome:** … **Edge cases:** … Edge-case behavior lives here and
  in task verification, never as extra acceptance criteria.
- **Design.** How the feature attaches to the existing architecture: new/changed
  data models, API/interface contracts (define these first: they're the hardest to
  change later), module boundaries, and which existing patterns/utilities are reused.
  Cite actual files. State what each new module knows about and what it must NOT
  know about. Design states contracts (signatures, data shapes, field names,
  types, nullability) and decisions, never algorithms: step-by-step procedures,
  command sequences with bodies, and a deliverable file's literal text belong to
  the task list. For a file the plan will cause to be
  written, name the file and state its required content here, but do not
  pre-write the implementation.
- **Stages.** Ordered vertical slices, riskiest first, each leaving the app
  working and demonstrable. One line per stage: its goal, why it holds this
  position, and what is observable when it ends. No per-task detail. Files
  touched, effort, and verify steps belong to the task list, whose skill
  decomposes each stage.
- **Data & compatibility.** Migrations needed; backward compatibility with existing
  data, APIs, and clients; the rollback story if the feature must be pulled after
  partial or full rollout.
- **Testing strategy.** What gets unit vs integration coverage, per stage. This is
  a pointer for a later test-writing pass (the write-tests skill), not the tests
  themselves.
- **Open questions.** Genuine unknowns only, each with the options and your
  recommendation. A routine detail left open is not a question: pick a
  well-accepted default, write the body as settled, and record the choice under
  assumptions where it can be challenged. An empty section is the correct outcome
  where no genuine unknown remains; padding it is not.
- **Adjacent opportunities.** At most 3, one line each: reasonable nice-to-have
  features near this work that the request did not ask for, each closed with a
  build-now or skip recommendation. Label them as not requested (never present
  one as a requirement) and write none into a phase, criterion or contract: they
  are offers the user may promote in a later revision, and this rule adds no
  approval stop to the workflow. Omitting the section when nothing genuine comes
  up is correct; padding it is not.
- **Alternatives considered and rejected.** Design alternatives a reader of the
  finished plan could reasonably propose, each with the reason it was not taken.
  At most 5, one line each; a bullet's sub-bullets count against the cap. Fuller
  analysis, and any reconnaissance notes worth keeping, go to a single linked
  appendix file: `<PLN-id>-appendix.md` beside the plan, linked from this
  section. The appendix is reference material for a human; downstream agents read
  the plan, never the appendix, and reconnaissance is never a plan section.

### Final summary

End with a short recap the user can act on without rereading: the chosen approach in
one line, stage count and effort ballpark, the top 2-3 risks, and the open
questions that need their answer. Keep it under ~10 lines.

## Planning principles

Apply these to every plan. The examples exist so plans come out consistent from run
to run. Use them as calibration, not as text to copy.

### Fit before invention

Extend existing patterns, modules, and conventions rather than introducing parallel
structures. A new abstraction needs a stated reason the existing ones can't serve.

- If every existing endpoint is `controller → service → repository`, the new feature
  is too. Don't introduce a "handlers/" directory or a CQRS layer because the
  feature feels different.
- If the codebase already has a `retry.utils.ts`, the plan reuses it rather than
  planning a new backoff helper; if it cannot serve (say, it's HTTP-specific
  and you need queue retries), the plan says exactly why.
- If validation is done with an existing schema library at the route boundary, new
  input validation goes through the same library at the same boundary, not hand
  -rolled checks inside the service.

### YAGNI & minimal scope

Plan the requirement, not the imagined future around it. No speculative config,
plugin points, or generalization.

- Feature says "export as CSV" → plan a CSV exporter, not an "export framework" with
  a format-strategy interface and one implementation.
- One consumer needs the data → return it from the existing service; don't plan an
  event bus so "other consumers can subscribe later".
- If the user's own request includes gold-plating ("make it configurable per tenant"
  when there's one tenant), flag it at intake as a descope candidate rather than
  silently planning it.

### Contracts first

Nail down data shapes, API signatures, and module interfaces before sequencing the
work that depends on them. They're the most expensive things to change later.

- Define the new table/collection schema and the API request/response shapes in the
  Design section (every field, type and nullability) before any phase references
  them. The contract, not the finished artefact: a deliverable's literal text
  belongs to the task that writes it.
- If two phases share a new module, the plan writes that module's public interface
  (function signatures, types) in Design so both phases build against the same thing.
- An external-facing contract (webhook payload, public API field) gets extra
  scrutiny: name the fields, types, and nullability now. Renaming after release is
  a breaking change.

### Separation of concerns & coupling

New code lands in the layer it belongs to. For each new module, the plan states what
it knows about and, as important, what it must NOT know about.

- The notification module knows "send message X to user Y"; it must NOT know why the
  message is being sent or import the order module's types to find out.
- Request parsing and auth checks live at the boundary (controller/route); the
  service receives validated, typed input and must NOT re-check auth or read raw
  request objects.
- A new integration with an external API gets one wrapper module; the rest of the
  code depends on the wrapper's interface, never on the vendor SDK directly.

### Incremental delivery

Every phase is shippable and verifiable on its own, a vertical slice, not a
horizontal layer. No phase larger than a reviewable unit of work.

- Wrong: Phase 1 "all models", Phase 2 "all endpoints", Phase 3 "wire up UI":
  nothing works until phase 3. Right: Phase 1 delivers one thin end-to-end path
  (one model, one endpoint, one screen state) that can be demonstrated.
- If the feature can't ship whole, prefer a feature flag or dark launch (endpoint
  live but unlinked) over a long-lived branch.
- A phase that can't be verified by observable behavior or a test is either too big
  or sliced wrong. Re-cut it.

### Compatibility & reversibility

Never break existing consumers silently. Additive over destructive.

- Add the new field/endpoint alongside the old, migrate callers, then remove. Three
  steps in the plan, not one "rename" task.
- Data-shape changes are staged expand → migrate → contract when live data exists:
  add the nullable column, backfill, then tighten constraints in a later phase.
- Every plan answers "how do we pull this feature if it's wrong?": a flag to flip,
  a migration to reverse, or an explicit "not reversible past phase N, because X".

### Non-functional requirements

Address performance, security, and observability proportionally to the feature:
real analysis where it matters, one line where it doesn't. Never write text that
would fit any feature.

- A new public endpoint: who is authorized to call it, and where input validation
  happens, named in the plan, at the same boundary the codebase already uses.
- A feature processing user-uploaded files or unbounded lists: the plan says what
  happens at 10,000× the expected size (limit, paginate, stream, or reject).
- Observability: what to log or measure to know the feature works in production,
  e.g. "log export failures with the document id; count exports per day". For an
  internal-only utility, "existing request logging suffices" is a complete answer.

## Task list export (only on request)

If the user asks for the plan in their task-list format, invoke the **fc-task-list**
skill and follow its schema exactly (it owns the format: don't reproduce it from
memory). Mapping:

- Feature file: `flowcharge/workstreams/<WS-N-SUFFIX>-<slug>/<TL-id>-tasklist.md`, reusing the
  plan's own workstream folder and slug, with the plan's Summary as the feature
  summary block, and its `TL-N` id claimed with the same `--claim` command
  (`TL` type) the same way the plan's `PLN-N` was claimed above.
- Each **stage** becomes a parent task (`description` only).
- The task skill decomposes each stage into child tasks, derived from the
  stage's goal, the plan's Design contracts, and the acceptance criteria. The
  plan carries no per-task detail to copy. For `imports`, `compatibility` and
  `gotcha`, a child names the plan's Design contract (plan id plus section) and
  adds only task-local facts the plan does not state. The plan owns decisions
  and contracts; the task list owns the executable steps. One fact, one owner.
- A stage whose whole scope is one atomic change becomes an adult task instead
  of a parent with one child.

The export realises the plan's stages as tasks; the rest of the plan (design,
open questions) stays in the plan file. Inside a `flowcharge` pipeline the merged
`plan-and-tasks` operation owns this step, and it authors a plan only when its
`{stages}` slot is set to `plan-only`.
